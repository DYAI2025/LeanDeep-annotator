  positive:
  - "Ask Sarah what she thinks. You made me involve her because you won't listen to reason."
  - "Even Mike agrees with me. Whatever, if you want to ignore everyone else's opinion."
  - "Talk to your sister about this. You forced me to get others involved in our business."
  - "Everyone can see what's happening. How nice that you make me look crazy to our friends."
  - "Your mother understands my point. You made this into a bigger issue than it needs to be."
  - "Check with David if you don't believe me. I guess my word isn't good enough anymore."
  - "Lisa had the same experience. You're making me prove myself to third parties now."
  - "Ask anyone what they would do. Fine, we'll let others judge since you won't trust me."
  - "Your friend agrees this is unfair. You forced me to seek validation elsewhere."
  - "Everyone sees how you treat me. Whatever, keep making me the villain to everyone."
  negative:
  - Ask Sarah what she thinks. I felt involve her because you won't listen to reason.
  - I see it differently, but I respect your view.
  - I want to be honest with you, even though it's hard.
  - You're right, that was my mistake. I'm sorry.
  - Let's both explain our side.
  - I feel uncomfortable about this and want to talk about it.
  - I understand why you see it that way.
