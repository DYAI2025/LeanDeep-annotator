examples:
  positive:
  - "This app is so impersonal. Let's switch to WhatsApp, it feels more authentic."
  - "I can't send high-quality videos here. Give me your number, then I'll show you where I am right now."
  - "I'm rarely online here, to be honest. On Telegram I reply to you immediately."
  - "The notifications here barely work. Before we lose sight of each other, let's write on Signal instead."
  - "I think my membership here expires soon. Let's stay in touch via email to be safe."
  - "This platform has too many limitations for what we're trying to do together."
  - "Can we move this conversation somewhere more private and personal?"
  - "I prefer using WhatsApp for more intimate conversations like this one."
  - "Email would be better for sharing the detailed information you need."
  - "Let's switch to a platform where we can communicate more freely."
  negative:
  - I choose not to send high-quality videos here. Give me your number, then I'll show you where I am right now.
  - I see it differently, but I respect your view.
  - I want to be honest with you, even though it's hard.
  - You're right, that was my mistake. I'm sorry.
  - Let's both explain our side.
  - I feel uncomfortable about this and want to talk about it.
  - I understand why you see it that way.
