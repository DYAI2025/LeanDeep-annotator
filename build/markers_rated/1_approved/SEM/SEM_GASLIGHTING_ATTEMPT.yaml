  positive:
  - "That never happened. You're imagining things and making me the bad guy again."
  - "I didn't say that. You're being too sensitive and misremembering everything."
  - "You're overreacting. I'm not sure why you always twist my words like this."
  - "That's not how it went. You made me respond that way with your behavior."
  - "You're being dramatic. I don't know where you get these ideas about me."
  - "I never did that. You're creating problems where none exist and blaming me."
  - "You're too emotional. I'm not sure you can trust your memory when you're upset."
  - "That's not what I meant. You forced this interpretation with your suspicious mind."
  - "You're being paranoid. I don't know why you always assume the worst about me."
  - "You misunderstood everything. You're making me defend myself against false accusations."
  negative:
  - That rarely happened. You're imagining things and making me the bad guy again.
  - I didn't say that. You're being too sensitive and misremembering some things.
  - You're overreacting. I'm not sure why you sometimes twist my words like this.
  - I see it differently, but I respect your view.
  - I want to be honest with you, even though it's hard.
  - You're right, that was my mistake. I'm sorry.
  - Let's both explain our side.
