examples:
  positive:
  - "I'm torn between taking the offer and staying put."
  - "On the one hand it’s exciting, on the other hand it scares me."
  - "I can't decide—both options have downsides."
  - "I'm going back and forth on this all week."
  - "Honestly, I'm sitting on the fence right now."
  - "I keep changing my mind about the trip."
  - "Unsure whether to say yes or wait."
  - "I waver between 'do it' and 'leave it'."
  - "Not ready to commit to either plan."
  - "I'm split—part of me wants it, part of me doesn't."
  negative:
  - I choose not to decide—both options have downsides.
  - I'm going back and forth on this some week.
  - I think we should discuss this calmly.
  - That's a good point you're making.
  - I understand your perspective.
  - Let's find a solution together.
  - I've noticed we think differently about this.
