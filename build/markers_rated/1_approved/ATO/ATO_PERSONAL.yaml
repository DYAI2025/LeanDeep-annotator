  - "Can we talk more personally?"
  - "I prefer private conversations"
  - "This feels too intimate for here"
  negative:
  - I think we should discuss this calmly.
  - That's a good point you're making.
  - I understand your perspective.

  - I've noticed we think differently about this.
  - I want to understand what you mean.
  - That sounds like an important topic for you.
