- type: regex
  value: "(?i)(with the complexity you.{0,10}adding)"
examples:
  positive:
  - you might hit some interesting challenges around scaling
  - Happy to bounce ideas sometime
  - With the complexity you're adding, you might hit some challenges
  - challenges around scaling and architecture
  - happy to chat about your approach
  negative:
  - You'll hit a race condition when alarms fire concurrently with message handlers
  - The storage sync limit is 8KB per item — this will break at scale
  - Happy to help debug the webpack config — I had the same issue with MV3 HMR
  - Consider using a connection pool to handle the scaling concern in your DB layer
