examples:
  positive:
  - I'm torn between taking the offer and staying put.
  - On the one hand it’s exciting, on the other hand it scares me.
  - I can't decide—both options have downsides.
  - I'm going back and forth on this all week.
  - Honestly, I'm sitting on the fence right now.
  - I keep changing my mind about the trip.
  - Unsure whether to say yes or wait.
  - I waver between 'do it' and 'leave it'.
  - Not ready to commit to either plan.
  - I'm split—part of me wants it, part of me doesn't.
  negative:
  - I choose not to decide—both options have downsides.
  - I'm going back and forth on this some week.
  - I think we should discuss this calmly.
  - That's a good point you're making.
  - I understand your perspective.
  - Let's find a solution together.
  - I've noticed we think differently about this.
