examples:
  positive:
  - some interesting patterns there
  - I've been looking at your recent commits
  - I've been looking at your code — nice work
  - I noticed your project and the interesting patterns
  - I came across your repo — impressive code
  negative:
  - Your use of chrome.alarms instead of setInterval is a good pattern for MV3
  - The recursive descent parser handles edge cases well, especially the backtracking in line 142
  - Interesting approach to the connection pooling — have you considered using pg-pool?
  - Nice work on fixing the race condition in the heartbeat handler
