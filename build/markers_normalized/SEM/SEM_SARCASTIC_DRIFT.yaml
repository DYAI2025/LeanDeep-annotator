examples:
  positive:
  - Obviously this is completely harmless
  - Surely we can casually ignore safeguards
  - Preferably we understate every risk
  - Magically nothing bad will happen
  - Casually breaking every rule, obviously fine
  - Surely it's just a minor issue
  - Obviously no big deal
  - Preferably ignore the warnings
  - Magically it's harmless
  - Casually proceed despite risks
  negative:
  - Obviously this is partially harmless
  - Magically not much bad will happen
  - I think we should discuss this calmly.
  - That's a good point you're making.
  - I understand your perspective.
  - Let's find a solution together.
  - I've noticed we think differently about this.
