examples:
  positive:
  - I need some space to process this. I realize my emotions are too high right now.
  - I won't continue this conversation today. I'm feeling overwhelmed and need to breathe.
  - I can't discuss this anymore tonight. I understand we both need to calm down first.
  - That's my limit for today. I see that we're both getting triggered and need a break.
  - I'm not comfortable with this direction. I notice I'm getting defensive and should step back.
  - I need to set a clear boundary here about what I will and won't discuss.
  - I won't engage with personal attacks. I realize we need to find a better way.
  - I can't handle this level of intensity right now. Perhaps we should revisit this later.
  - That crosses a line for me. I understand you're upset but I need respect too.
  - I'm not willing to continue if we can't speak to each other civilly.
  negative:
  - I choose not to discuss this anymore tonight. I understand we both need to calm down first.
  - Can you pass the salt?
  - The meeting is at 2 PM.
  - I went shopping yesterday.
  - The weather should be better tomorrow.
  - Did you read the email?
  - I need to get gas.
