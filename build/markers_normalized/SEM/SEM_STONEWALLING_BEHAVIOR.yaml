  positive:
  - I won't discuss this anymore. Fine, we'll just sit here in silence then.
  - I need to shut down now. Whatever you want to say, I'm done listening.
  - I can't deal with this. I'm feeling nothing right now, completely checked out.
  - I'm not responding anymore. As you wish, we'll just stop communicating altogether.
  - This conversation is over. I need to emotionally disconnect to protect myself.
  - I won't engage with this. Fine, we'll just pretend everything is normal instead.
  - I'm done talking about it. Whatever, silence is easier than this constant conflict.
  - I can't continue this way. I'm shutting down emotionally to survive this.
  - No more words from me. I feel like I need to build walls to protect myself.
  - I'm closing off completely. As you wish, we'll just exist in separate bubbles.
  negative:
  - I want to shut down now. Whatever you want to say, I'm done listening.
  - I can't deal with this. I'm feeling not much right now, partially checked out.
  - I choose not to deal with this. I'm feeling nothing right now, completely checked out.
  - I see it differently, but I respect your view.
  - I want to be honest with you, even though it's hard.
  - You're right, that was my mistake. I'm sorry.
  - Let's both explain our side.
