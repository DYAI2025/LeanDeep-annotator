description: 'Aggregates advanced flirting sequences across a window: friendly teasing, bolder innuendo, soft-commitment, latent expectations, boundary shifts, mirroring, and tight response timing.'
frame:
  signal:
  - playful tease
  - innuendo
  - soft commitment
  - latent expectation
  - boundary shift
  - mirrored style
  - fast ping-pong timing
  concept: Flirt dynamic over time
  pragmatics: Increased intimacy, ambivalence management
  narrative: Orbiting between playful closeness and controlled distance
patterns: []
examples:
  positive:
  - A playful barb → answered with a wink emoji and a coy comeback.
  - Light tease escalates to cheeky innuendo two turns later.
  - Soft 'we could meet next weekend' + 'sounds nice, no pressure' loop.
  - Hinted expectation ('you’ll text tonight, right?') without explicit ask.
  - Boundary nudge ('VIP pass required') acknowledged with playful consent.
  - Mirrored tone and emoji style across several exchanges.
  - Rapid back-and-forth (<30s replies) sustained for three rounds.
  - "Secretive framing: 'delete later' + 'got it—stealth mode.'"
  - Novelty burst (impromptu poem) reciprocated with playful rhyme.
  - "Ambivalence preserved: 'we should define this' → 'not today—rain check.'"
  negative:
  - I think we should discuss this calmly.
  - That's a good point you're making.
  - I understand your perspective.
  - Let's find a solution together.
  - I've noticed we think differently about this.
  - I want to understand what you mean.
  - That sounds like an important topic for you.
