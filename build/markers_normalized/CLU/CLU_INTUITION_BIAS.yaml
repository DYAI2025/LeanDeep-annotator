  signal:
  - intuition

  concept: Emerging bias pattern hypothesis
  pragmatics: Early bias detection for intervention
  narrative: hypothesis
patterns: []
examples:
  positive:
  - Early generalization followed by certainty markers
  - Stereotyping language with emerging rigidity
  - Multiple weak bias signals clustering
  - Attribution errors starting to compound
  - Initial us-vs-them language formation
  - Early stereotyping + 'case closed' vibe
  - Initial 'always/never' + dismissal of nuance
  - Subtle us–them hint + fast generalization
  - Premature certainty + ignoring alternate causes
  - Quick label + selective memory
  negative:
  - I think we should discuss this calmly.
  - That's a good point you're making.
  - I understand your perspective.
  - Let's find a solution together.
  - I've noticed we think differently about this.
  - I want to understand what you mean.
  - That sounds like an important topic for you.
