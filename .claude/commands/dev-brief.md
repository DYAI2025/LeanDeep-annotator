description: Write a structured developer specification (.md) for a feature or component — requirements only, no implementation

## Context

LeanDeep is a deterministic annotation engine with a REST API. When planning new components (frontend, integrations, modules), the user wants structured developer briefs — NOT implementation code.

**Target files:**
- `FRONTEND_DEV_AUFTRAG.md` (root) — for frontend specs
- `docs/[FEATURE]_BRIEF.md` — for other feature specs

**API Docs:** https://leandeep.fly.dev/docs
**Design-System:** See `FRONTEND_DEV_AUFTRAG.md` for established design tokens (colors, typography, shadows, radii)

## Your Task

Write a developer specification as a markdown file. This is a requirements document, NOT implementation.

### Steps

1. **Understand scope** — Ask what component/feature needs a brief if not obvious from the user's message.

2. **Gather context** — Read relevant existing files:
   - `CLAUDE.md` for current project state
   - `docs/ROADMAP.md` for planned features
   - Any existing briefs (`FRONTEND_DEV_AUFTRAG.md`, `docs/FRONTEND_BRIEF.md`)
   - API endpoints from `api/main.py` if the feature involves API integration
   - Design references if provided (zips, screenshots, URLs)

3. **Write the brief** with these sections:
   - **Produkt** — What this is, one paragraph
   - **Zielgruppe** — Who uses this
   - **Ziel** — What success looks like
   - **Tech-Stack** — Table with recommended technologies and reasoning
   - **Design-System** — Color tokens, typography, shadows (reuse from existing briefs if applicable)
   - **Seiten / Views** — Each page with: purpose, API endpoints, input fields, output display
   - **API-Anbindung** — Concrete fetch examples with request/response
   - **Nicht im Scope** — What's explicitly excluded
   - **Abnahmekriterien** — Numbered list of acceptance criteria

4. **Save** — Write to the appropriate location (root for major specs, `docs/` for sub-features)

### Guardrails

- **Nur Anforderungen** — Never write implementation code. No React components, no API routes. Only the spec.
- **German labels, English technical terms** — Match the project's mixed-language style
- **Reuse design tokens** — If a design system exists, reference it. Don't invent new colors.
- **Concrete API examples** — Include actual fetch calls with real endpoint URLs, not placeholders
- **If design references provided** — Analyze what fits and what needs adaptation. Be honest about gaps.
